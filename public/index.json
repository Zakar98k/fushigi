Not speaking in the bandwidth sense, but in the sense that I spend a lot of my time on sites like Youtube, Discord, and Instagram.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s not limited to social-media sites only. Sometimes I would spend hours deathscrolling through sites like Pinterest, Twitter, and Reddit. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t get bored of it too, I ignored the work I needed to do, because I chose instant gratification.\nHours and hours \u0026ndash; and sometimes a full day \u0026ndash; would go by without me realizing it.\nAll of this gradually dulled my attention-span and ability to focus, which is everything to me as a student. I also started to feel like a lesser human, cause I wasn\u0026rsquo;t being as efficient when it came to learning or being productive.\nWhy write about this? # This post might seem a little vent-y, but I write about this because I want to remind myself and kind of acknowledge that it is a problem. (it has been for a long time, personally)\nThe more we try our best to avoid instant gratification, the more clear our mind is, and as a result improves focus. Taking those steps to kind of set up guardrails around distractions can help build healthy habits, and break bad habits.\nThings that help me stay productive # Unhook # Browser extensions like unhook allow you to hide YouTube\u0026rsquo;s recommended section, making it significantly harder to get distracted unless you deliberately choose to do so. (see screenshot below)\nNo thumbnails = less things to click on Unhook has options to disable the subscriptions, comments, and even the Youtube shorts buttons.\nThere are also other web-extensions that can block websites during a specific period of time. (I wont list any here, because I personally didn\u0026rsquo;t see the need for them yet)\npomofocus.io # I think that the pomodoro is a great productivity system. It allows your work to be more focused, and your breaks to be effective.\npomofocus.io allows you to define tasks that can be completed through pomodoro intervals. You can even set custom intervals and work/break times to suit your preference.\nDashboard for pomofocus Have a list of stuff you wanna learn or do # If you\u0026rsquo;re a programmer like me, having a list of technologies you want to learn keeps you organized and on track.\nSit down and think about what field of programming you want to get into, be it front-end development, data-science, or whatever. Make a list of new technologies you want to learn, relative to the field you wish to explore. This could be a programming language, a new JavaScript framework, a skill like UI Design or database management, etc Set your goals according to the list of technologies you want to learn If you want to dip your toes in C++, an example goal would be to: finish 4hr introductory course on YT about C++ ","date":"25 February 2024","permalink":"/posts/instant_gratification_overstimulation_and_brainrot/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m gonna be talking about instant gratification, its negative effects, and the things you can do to combat it.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Instant Gratification, Overstimulation, and Brainrot"},{"content":"","date":"25 February 2024","permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":"25 February 2024","permalink":"/tags/self-improvement/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Self-Improvement"},{"content":"","date":"25 February 2024","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 February 2024","permalink":"/tags/hugo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hugo"},{"content":"Yup, the mandatory first post for all personal websites, where the author talk about their experience in making it, blah blah\nNew site? # Yup. I don\u0026rsquo;t plan on keeping the old one, since it\u0026rsquo;s outdated and it\u0026rsquo;s hard to keep it updated with new content. My current site (this one) is built with hugo, a framwork for building static sites by converting markdown files into HTML.\nWhy make a new one?\nWhile I do like the ideas and the look and feel of my previous website, I also want to move on to more a more modern approach and framework. Hugo does exactly that, and it makes it so easy to update the site, add new content/posts to it, styling it, etc. Highly recommend that you check Hugo out, it has a lot of cool stuff like HTML templates \u0026amp; variables, shortcodes, methods, and themes.\nMaking the new site # How hard is it to get a website out there on the internet?\nI\u0026rsquo;d say not too difficult, as long as you know how the basics work (HTML, CSS, domains). A lot of information is available online on how to get sites up and running with different services (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, and others)\nYou can view the GitHub repo for the site here:\nZakar98k/fushigi Personal site built with Hugo and themed with Risotto HTML 1 0 About my projects # How are you spending time as someone who is currently learning programming/gamedev?\nI\u0026rsquo;m currently working on a game for my final project for CS50 (yes long overdue).
