I don\u0026rsquo;t plan on keeping the old one, since it\u0026rsquo;s outdated and it\u0026rsquo;s hard to keep it updated with new content. My current site (this one) is built with hugo, a framwork for building static sites by converting markdown files into HTML.\nWhy make a new one?\nWhile I do like the ideas and the look and feel of my previous website, I also want to move on to more a more modern approach and framework. Hugo does exactly that, and it makes it so easy to update the site, add new content/posts to it, styling it, etc. Highly recommend that you check Hugo out, it has a lot of cool stuff like HTML templates \u0026amp; variables, shortcodes, methods, and themes.\nAbout my projects # How are you spending time as someone who is currently learning programming/gamedev?\nI\u0026rsquo;m currently working on a game for my final project for CS50 (yes long overdue). The game concept being a platformer version of dark-souls. Definitely keep an eye out for that.\nThat is all\nThanks for reading, and I hope you have a great day! ðŸ˜Œ\n","date":"22 February 2024","permalink":"/posts/my_first_post/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYup, the mandatory first post for all personal websites, where the author talk about their experience in making it, blah blah\u003c/p\u003e","title":"My First Post"},{"content":"","date":"22 February 2024","permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":" print(\u0026ldquo;hello world\u0026rdquo;) # Hey there ðŸ‘‹.
