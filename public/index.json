I don\u0026rsquo;t plan on keeping the old one, since it\u0026rsquo;s outdated and it\u0026rsquo;s hard to keep it updated with new content. My current site (this one) is built with hugo, a framwork for building static sites by converting markdown files into HTML.\nWhy make a new one?\nWhile I do like the ideas and the look and feel of my previous website, I also want to move on to more a more modern approach and framework. Hugo does exactly that, and it makes it so easy to update the site, add new content/posts to it, styling it, etc. Highly recommend that you check Hugo out, it has a lot of cool stuff like HTML templates \u0026amp; variables, shortcodes, methods, and themes.\nAbout my projects # How are you spending time as someone who is currently learning programming/gamedev?\nI\u0026rsquo;m currently working on a few games and projects, namely my 2D space shooter, Space Pirate April. Bookmark my site or the project\u0026rsquo;s Github repo if you want to stay updated. (I might be able to get RSS working in the future so stay tuned for that as well)\nThat is all\nThanks for reading, and I hope you have a great day! ðŸ˜Œ\n","date":"22 February 2024","permalink":"/posts/my_first_post/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYup, the mandatory first post for all personal websites, where the author talk about their experience in making it, blah blah\u003c/p\u003e","title":"My First Post"},{"content":"","date":"22 February 2024","permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":" print(\u0026ldquo;hello world\u0026rdquo;) # Hi, Iâ€™m Zach.
