Yup, the mandatory first post for all personal websites, where the author talk about their experience in making it, blah blah

<!--more-->

## New site?
Yup. I don't plan on keeping the [old one](https://zakar98k.github.io/z-station), since it's outdated and it's hard to keep it updated with new content. My current site (this one) is built with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a framwork for building static sites by converting markdown files into HTML.

> Why make a new one?

While I do like the ideas and the look and feel of my previous website, I also want to move on to more a more modern approach and framework. Hugo does exactly that, and it makes it so easy to update the site, add new content/posts to it, styling it, etc. Highly recommend that you check Hugo out, it has a lot of cool stuff like HTML templates & variables, shortcodes, methods, and themes.

## Making the new site
> How hard is it to get a website out there on the internet?

I'd say not too difficult, as long as you know how the basics work (HTML, CSS, domains). A lot of information is available online on how to get sites up and running with different services (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, and others)

## About my projects
> How are you spending time as someone who is currently learning programming/gamedev?

I'm currently working on a game for my final project for CS50 (yes long overdue). The game concept being a platformer version of dark-souls. Definitely keep an eye out for that.

That is all

Thanks for reading, and I hope you have a great day! ðŸ˜Œ
